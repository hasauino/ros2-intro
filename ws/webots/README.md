# Webots Simulation

Webots simulation file will be generated in this folder. After you launch a simulation from inside the container, a file will be created here.

## Example

- Launch Turtlebot simulation:

```bash
ros2 launch tabit turtlebot.launch.py
```

- From the host (outside the container), open the file using Webots simulator.
